    "content": "<p>Children will learn all 26 letters of the English alphabet from A to Z. Each letter has a sound which they can practice by singing the alphabet song. Recognizing letters and associating them with objects helps build memory and phonics skills. For example, A is for Apple 🍎, B is for Ball ⚽. Teachers can use flashcards, objects, and songs to make learning fun. Pupils should practice both uppercase and lowercase letters and attempt tracing them on paper. This foundation will help children in reading and writing words in later lessons. Engaging activities like letter hunts around the classroom or identifying letters in storybooks make learning interactive and enjoyable.</p>",

Starting with 2–3 letter words like cat 🐱, dog 🐶, and sun ☀️, children are encouraged to sound out each letter and blend them together. Writing these words repeatedly helps reinforce memory. Teachers can introduce small word games such as word matching or letter rearrangement to make learning engaging. Understanding simple words allows children to form basic sentences and communicate ideas effectively.
