    "content": "<p>Numbers are the basic foundation of mathematics. In this lesson, pupils will learn how to count, recognize, and write numbers from 1 to 20. Counting is the act of saying numbers in their correct order, while recognition means identifying the symbols for each number (1, 2, 3, etc.). Pupils are encouraged to use fingers, sticks, bottle tops, and objects around them for practice. Teachers should also introduce number songs and rhymes to make counting fun. Writing numbers can begin by tracing dotted patterns on paper or in sand with a stick. This helps children improve their motor skills and understanding. Counting forward and backward develops fluency and prepares them for addition and subtraction later.</p>",
    "examples": [
      "Count 10 bottle tops 🟢",

    "id": "addition",
    "title": "Simple Addition",
    "content": "<p>Addition means putting two or more groups of things together to find the total. For example, 2 pencils plus 3 pencils equals 5 pencils. Pupils learn addition by using real-life objects such as fruits, toys, bottle tops, and blocks. Teachers can also introduce number lines where pupils jump forward to add. Starting with small numbers builds confidence before moving to larger numbers. Addition is a foundation for multiplication and higher mathematics later in life.</p>",

    "title": "Simple Subtraction",
    "content": "<p>Subtraction means taking away from a group of objects to see how many are left. For example, if you have 5 oranges and eat 2, then 3 are left. Subtraction is the opposite of addition. Pupils can practice subtraction using toys, snacks, or bottle tops. Teachers can also use number lines by moving backwards. Subtraction is useful in everyday life when sharing food, spending money, or dividing items. Repetition with real-life examples makes subtraction easy to understand.</p>",

For example, a ball is a circle, a book is a rectangle, and a slice of bread can be a square. Linking shapes to real-life objects makes learning fun. Pupils also learn primary colors (red, blue, yellow) and secondary colors (green, orange, purple). This builds observation and creativity.</p>",
